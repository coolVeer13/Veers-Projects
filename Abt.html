        Hello, Im Veer Upadhye, we met outside at the home page, but did you ckick the about me button, or the linked text?
        But anyways, I live in Loudoun VA, and I love it here.
        </h1h1>
        <h1><br>
        I am also one who thinks that there are way too many data centers, and am fighting to make ten commertial lots to be made parks, for people to enjoy nature, insteat of huge concrete blocks that are the size of an office.
        </h1>
        <h1><br>
        I also enjoy dirtbiking, I ride a Honda CRF125 BigWheel, and love it. I also am working to legalize ebike and dirt bike usage. I personnaly think if some adults think we never touch grass and only play games and text each other. Then theres the ebike and dirt bike kids, eager to get on and ride around, to a friends house or really anything, working together to
        orginize rides and hangouts, but all of a sudden, thats bad too. People steriotype us by being recklass kids who are rude or disrespectful, want to run from cops, and just want to fish for trouble for fun. But thats a small amount of us, we just want to get around and be respectful, but we just cant. We feel 
        ready to work so we can decorate of mod our bikes, we learn elecronics and engineering working on our rigs, we go outside, we learn new skills, help each other, but thats bad too.
</h1>
<h1><br>
        Aside from that I am the founder and captain of the Cyber Eagles FTC team, team 27662. I got waitlisted from the school team, and didnt feel like waiting just to possibly get waitlisted again, so I made the Cyber Eagles. In our rookie season, we were about to qualify until the team allience robot broke, we went from seventh 
        to fifteenth. But we were still so proud of how far we got in our first year, and that we won the Innovation Award presented by Raytheon, because of my claw design, which I designed and 3d printed my self.
